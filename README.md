This is a combined Asset management Program / Computerized maintenence management program

This will be used for the Winter 2017 GVSU Computer Science Project Team writing this project

Please do NOT directly commit to this branch...   
Proper branching method for this is:

Main Branch
           \
            Forked Branch for each team member (Can include additional branches within the fork)
                                              \
                                               Local Branch (Branch actually on local computer. Includes all WIP)
                                                          
Proper work flow is to use local branch to do work in progress and use forked branch as a backup and for
work to be pushed to the main branch.  

Completed work needs to be pushed to the Main branch from the Forked Branch.
